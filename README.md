This project is used to compare audio files in a directory and list out all those files that are similar. Files are compared byte by byte.


AudioCompare
============

This project is used to compare audio files placed in a directory. 
All the files are compared to each other bit by bit.
Files are not compared according to their size and name.
End user get the list of all files that are duplicate and taking up extra space on disk.

Features/Enhancements that need to be done -
1. Optimization of the algorithm. Since a directory can contain thousand files. It may a long time for the code to find out the duplicates.
2. Creating a simple UI that allows the user to select the directory and let them delete the duplicate files.
